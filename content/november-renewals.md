# November Sprint: Maintenance Contract Renewals

It’s renewal season – and the clock is ticking.

Maintenance contracts are the backbone of your business—the steady, reliable revenue that keeps everything running. But if it’s closing in on the end of October and your January 1 renewals aren’t already in motion, you’re officially in **crunch time**.

You don’t have time to overthink this—you’ve got to move.  
That’s where **Momentum Lab** comes in. We’ll walk you through exactly what to do, in what order, so you stop scrambling and start locking in revenue for the year ahead.  
**No chaos. No guesswork. Just clarity, action, and results.**

---

## Is this for you?

You’re headed into your first or second renewal season and want it to go smoother, faster, and with fewer headaches than last time.

> To keep it tight and interactive, we’re capping registration at **10 companies**. If registration is full, join the waiting list.

## What you’ll get

When you register, you’ll receive the full sprint syllabus, two action emails per week, and a complete **PDF playbook** with all resources used during the sprint.

**Highlights**

### Week 1 — Get in the Game
We jump right into the technical side of Aspire: the details, settings, and workflows that make renewals work (and what breaks them). Includes a group kickoff call to set targets and get you moving.

### Week 2 — Eliminate Chaos to Execute
Now it’s time to move. We’ll map out who does what, when, and why, so everyone knows their lane. If your team is prone to finger-pointing, this week fixes that fast. Includes a group work session.

### Week 3 — Track the Wins
If you can’t see progress, you’ll lose momentum. We’ll build your renewal scoreboard to track the metrics that show what’s working and what’s lagging. Includes a private **1:1** call with a facilitator for laser feedback.

### Week 4 — Lock It In
Turn your wins into systems. Together, we’ll document SOPs, refine best practices, and lock in what’s working so you’re ready to rinse and repeat next year. Includes a second group work session.

## Schedule

**Monday, November 3 – Friday, November 28, 2025**  
4 weeks. One focus. Real results.

---

## Investment

**$599 (beta pricing)**

A fraction of what one lost renewal is worth—and the start of a smoother, more profitable renewal season.

---

## Why it works

Most Aspire problems aren’t technical. They’re human.  
Information isn’t the problem. **Execution is.** Too many priorities. Too little time. No finish line.

Momentum Lab fixes that by forcing focus: **one goal, one month, real accountability.**  
We don’t talk about progress—we **measure** it.

# Build momentum, not overwhelm.

**The Momentum Lab** is a series of focused, 4-week sprints for Aspire teams. Less noise, more action: learn, apply, repeat—until progress is a habit.

- **One focus at a time** so it’s doable  
- **Step-by-step plan** so there’s no guesswork  
- **Peer energy + facilitator support** so you finish  
- **Mini playbook** you keep at the end

## What it is

Hands-on sprints (not another webinar). We pick one practical theme and move it from *“we should do that”* to *done*.

- One focus per month (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced labeled)  
- Group kickoff, working sessions, and a 1:1 checkpoint  
- Monday “do this next” email + Thursday check-in  
- Templates, SOP starters, lists/reports you can customize

## How it works {#how-it-works}

1. **Kickoff (group):** align goals, pick your finish line  
2. **Working sessions / office hours:** get help and make live progress  
3. **1:1 checkpoint:** clear roadblocks  
4. **Weekly emails:** Monday playbook + Thursday check-in  
5. **End-of-sprint:** mini playbook (PDF) and next-step plan

> “You don’t need more information—you need a plan you’ll actually follow.”

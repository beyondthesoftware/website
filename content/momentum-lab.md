## Momentum Lab: Build Real Progress in Aspire — One Sprint at a Time

Stop putting it off. Start building momentum.  

If there’s a part of Aspire you’ve been meaning to set up or fix but just haven’t gotten around to it, this is your opportunity to own it. Your company depends on you to make it work.

**Momentum Lab is where talk turns into traction.**  
No fluff. No webinars you half-watch. Just structured, hands-on execution with a group that’s here to get it done.

---

## Why Momentum Lab

Aspire can feel overwhelming. You’re not alone.  
But overwhelm isn’t the problem, **staying stuck is**.

We strip it down to focus on one thing at a time:

- Simplify your focus  
- Make incremental progress  
- Build momentum that snowballs  

These are **hands-on implementation sprints**, not another training or webinar. You’ll roll up your sleeves and make real improvements inside Aspire with a small group doing the same thing right alongside you.

---

## This isn’t training. It’s action.

Aspire’s complexity can make everything feel important at once. Momentum Lab helps you cut through the noise and focus on the next most impactful thing.

Each sprint is built around a simple idea: **learn → apply → repeat**.  
Two out of three won’t get you there. Momentum Lab gives you all three—on a deadline.

**Every sprint includes:**
- Weekly calls with facilitators and peers who’ve been there
- Two action emails per week
- Group interaction for quick questions and accountability
- Templates, SOPs, and reports you can actually use
- Optional 1:1 support (for an additional fee)

## Who It’s For

If you’re ready to turn knowledge into action and carve out time to win, join us.  
Ideal for beginner–intermediate Aspire users (advanced users often join for accountability + polish).  
You’ll be the point person for your company/branch—and your whole team will feel the ripple effect.

**Time commitment:** Plan for 1–2 hours/week for calls + content.  
No shortcuts—just guided structure and accountability that deliver results.

## Investment

Each sprint runs **$500–$2,000**, depending on topic length and complexity.  
We’re offering **beta pricing** for early participants—a chance to join early, give feedback, and help define the future of Momentum Lab.

Not for looky-loos. This is for people who know the ROI of momentum.  
You’re not paying for information—you’re paying to **unlock it**.

---

## Why It Works

Because we do it **together**.

By the end of a sprint, you’ll have:
- A specific Aspire process built, cleaned, or fixed  
- A repeatable framework you can use again  
- Confidence from crushing your goal  

Real change takes time—but it starts with one focused step.

### About Momentum Lab

Momentum Lab is powered by Aspire consultants **Darrin Braun** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darrinbraun/)) and **Paula Suda** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paula-suda/)) - people who’ve seen every size of company wrestle with the same problems, from $1M startups to $100M powerhouses.

We’re done keeping the good stuff locked away in 1:1 consulting. Momentum Lab scales what works—the shortcuts, the clarity, the real progress.

Aspire is powerful—but it’s a beast. You don’t have to tackle it solo. We believe in the social side of getting things done, where momentum builds faster and wins stick longer.

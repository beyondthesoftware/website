# December Sprint: Operation Clean Slate  
### Put 2025 to Bed (and Set Up 2026 to Win)

You made it to the end of the year, just barely.  

If your Aspire system feels more like a tangled mess than a well-oiled machine, this December sprint is your reset button.  
No judgement here, just progress.

**Operation Clean Slate** is your chance to clear the clutter, close the loops, and walk into 2026 without dragging last year’s chaos along for the ride.  

This Momentum Lab sprint gives you all the Ws of cleanup: who, what, when, where, and why.  
And yes, we’ll throw in the most important one too: *how*.

Because talking about cleanup doesn’t clean anything. **Action does.**
  
> **_Due to December holidays, this sprint is compressed to 3 weeks instead of the usual 4._**  
> We’ll trade the usual 1:1 session for extra group work sessions so you can actually get things done in real time.  
> Need a little extra support? Just say the word — we’ve got options.

## This Sprint Is for You If…
You’ve ever used the words *messy*, *disorganized*, or *hot mess* to describe your Aspire system —  
and you don’t already have a plan for what to do next.

It doesn’t matter how experienced you are or how long you’ve been on the system, anyone can benefit from a year-end tidy.

We love and appreciate our Office Admins, but this one’s bigger than an Admin task list.  
(Please don’t give your Admin the holiday gift of your mess to clean up!)

**Operation Clean Slate** is designed for Aspire users who touch multiple areas of the business, such as a Branch Manager, Office Manager, or Systems Admin.

> To keep it tight and interactive, registration is capped at **10 companies**.  
> If registration is full, hop on the waiting list to make sure you’re next in line.

## What You’ll Get

You’ll receive:
- The full sprint syllabus up front  
- Calendar invites for all group sessions  
- Supportive email check-ins twice per week  
- A complete PDF playbook with all resources used during the sprint

### Highlights

### Week 1 – Reality Check
We’ll start by identifying where all the clutter is hiding.  
We’ll define “done” by building lists in a way that makes it obvious where the finish line is.  
And since you likely didn’t make the mess all by yourself, we’ll challenge you to get your teammates involved too.  
Week 1 includes a **kickoff call** and a **group work session** to get started.

### Week 2 – Clear the Chaos
We’ll share a few more tips for untangling some common complications, but Week 2 is mostly holding space for you to make progress.  
We’ll be your biggest cheerleaders and answer questions when you get stuck.  
This week includes **two group work sessions** to roll up your sleeves and get to work.

### Week 3 – Keep It Clean (For Good)
The ultimate goal is to not need a year-end cleanup effort in 2026.  
Now that your system is clean (or at least much cleaner), we’ll document SOPs, healthy habits, and make sure your team knows the expectations to keep the system tidy.  
Week 3 includes **one final group work session**.

## Schedule
**Monday, December 1 – Friday, December 19, 2025**  
3 weeks. *Put 2025 to bed. Start 2026 fresh.*

## Investment
**$599 beta pricing**

How much is it worth to you to be handed the cleanup checklist and some uninterrupted time to get it done?  
That’s priceless.

## Why It Works
Often with Aspire, the hardest part isn’t knowing what to do, it’s actually *doing* it.  

You’re in this situation because you always mean to get around to cleaning it up, but you never do. Right?!  
That’s human nature. We all do it.

Even though we all know that keeping things tidy in Aspire is a good habit, when things get busy, that’s one of the first things to go.

This sprint gives you permission to treat the work sessions like a **VIP client meeting**:
- Close your email  
- Don’t look at your phone  
- Don’t multitask  
- Hide out in a conference room so your coworkers can’t stop by your desk  

All those interruptions can wait an hour, just like they would if you were in that VIP client meeting.  
Give yourself the same respect you give your clients.
